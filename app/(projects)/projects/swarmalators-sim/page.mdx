I am UROPing with the Distributed Robotics Laboratory at MIT CSAIL. I'm implementing the [Swarmalator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swarmalators) model on physical robots to study the emergence of patterns in swarm robotics models. 

In the swarmalator model agents have a phase. Agents motion depends on their phase behaviour and their phase behaviour depends on their position. This allows many interesting patterns to emerge. 

While the physical robots are still in development, I have created a simulation of the swarmalator model based on the [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-36563-4) by Ceron, S., Oâ€™Keeffe, K. & Petersen, K. Diverse.
