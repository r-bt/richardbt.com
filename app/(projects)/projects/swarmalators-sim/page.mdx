At MIT I'm part of the Distributed Robotics Laboratory at MIT CSAIL. There I'm looking at implementing swarm robotics models on physical robots.

Specficially, I've been looking at the emergent behaviours that the [Swarmalator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swarmalators) model gives rise to.

In this model robots effect each other spatially (i.e. their position) and temporally (i.e. their phase) based on a set of equations. This leads to a variety of emergent behaviours such as synchronization, clustering, and bouncing, etc.

While the physical robots are still in development, I have created a simulation of the swarmalator model based on the [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-36563-4) by Ceron, S., Oâ€™Keeffe, K. & Petersen, K. Diverse.
