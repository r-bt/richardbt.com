This is a tool that let's you generate mazes where the solution spells out a message of your choosing. I was experimenting with the
Randomized Prim's algorithm and thought this would be a cool addition.

I'd like to credit Dr. David Grossman and his work on <a href="https://www.mazebrite.com/" className="underline">Mazebrite.com</a>, which provided the inspiration for this idea.
As I needed SVGs of the mazes, and Dr. Grossman's version is closed-source, I decided to create my own implementation. However, his font and mazes provided
inspiration for mine.

<MazeGenerator />

export default function MDXPage({ children }) {
  return <ProjectLayout metadata={metadata}>{children}</ProjectLayout>
