For a friends birthday I 3D printed them a puzzle box that required them to solve a maze to open it. The twist was that the solution to the maze spelled out their name. I wanted to make a program that could generate these puzzle boxes for any name. The first step was to create a maze generator that could take a message and turn it into a maze.

I'm still getting rid of some bugs, so if you find any phrases that don't work, please let me know!
