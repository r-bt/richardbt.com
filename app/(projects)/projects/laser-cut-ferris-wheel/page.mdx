I built this working Ferris Wheel as my week two assignment for How to Make Almost Anything (HTMAA) (6.9020). My objective was to learn about parametric design, [living hinges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_hinge), and wooden joints. All the pieces were designed first in Fusion 360 before being laser cut and assembled. No glue is used anywhere.    
 
## Designing the Ferris Wheel

I split my design into two parts:

1. The Ferris Wheel itself
2. The base

For the base I wanted to visualize how the sides would bend so I used the **Sheet Metal** tool in Fusion 360. This allowed me to fit together while bent, but export as a flatten DXF file for laser cutting in the end. I used a reference image for my living hinges and rectangular pattenered it on the sides of the base.

For the Ferris Wheel, I designed everything in sketches and extruded them. All the pieces have finger joints and I used the **Joint** tool to make sure everything fitted together in the end.

## Laser cutting the parts

To actually laser cut the parts I needed to account for kerf. Thankfully there is a Fusion360 plugin, [DXF For Laser](https://apps.autodesk.com/FUSION/en/Detail/Index?id=7634902334100976871&os=Win64&appLang=en), which can create **.dxf** files from your bodies faces and offsets the dimensions to account for kerf.

I exported all my bodies as .dxf files, made some test cuts, and then cut all of them out.

It took a few tries to get the kerf right, but in the end, and with the help of a pallet, everything fitted together.
