I am one of the TAs for [ES.100](http://student.mit.edu/catalog/search.cgi?search=ES.100) â€“ Introduction to Maker Skills. For the 2023 semester we got funding to run an LED Neon Sign making workshop. I decided to make an Appa sign to test out the process.

## Designing the Sign

I started by finding a good image of Appa. I then used Adobe Illustrator to convert the image into a vector of just lines. 

Then I offset all the paths to make the outline of the sign. 

The LED strips I used came in increments of 1in so I made sure to design the sign to fit within those constraints.

## Setting up the CAM

Once designed, I put the file into Fusion360 and setup the CAM. I used a 1/8" endmill to cut out the sign from a 1/4" sheet of acrylic.

## Cutting the Sign

Then I cut out the sign on the Shopbot CNC router.

## Wiring the Sign

This was the hardest part. I had to cut out the LED strips to fit into the different channels. Then I had solder them together and wrap the exposed wires in heat shrink to prevent shorts.

Since the copper pads on the LED strips were so small I had to used hot glue as a mechanical stress relief

Finally, I connected the sign to a 12V power supply and it lit up!
