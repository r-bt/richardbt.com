I am lucky to be part of the MIT glass blowing lab where I get to make all sorts of cool things **out of glass!**. I've currently taken the beginner class twice (Fall 2022 & Fall 2023) and the intermeditate class once (Spring 2024). 

The last week of begineer is always a project week where you can make anything you want. I decided to make a turtle.

## Other Glass Creations

I've made some other things in the glass lab. Here are some of my favorites:
