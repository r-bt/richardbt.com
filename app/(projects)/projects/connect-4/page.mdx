In Spring 2024, I took 6.115 (Microcomputer Project Laboratory) at MIT. It takes a deep dive into embedded systems. Over four labs we built circuits and wrote code to

- Find the resonant frequency of an fluroscent light and strike it
- Display a laser light show
- Control a robot arm
- Reconstruct a 3D object from 2D images

All of which was done on a 8-bit [Intel 8051](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MCS-51) microcontroller which we programmed in assembly.

For the last month of the class we had a final project. The only critera is that it has to use the [Cypress PSoC 5LP](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/product/microcontroller/32-bit-psoc-arm-cortex-microcontroller/32-bit-psoc-5-lp-arm-cortex-m3/). 

I decided to build a robot that could play Connect 4 on a physical board for a few reasons

- I love building things that interact with the physical world
- I wanted to explore the algorithms behind a game-playing AI
- **Most importantly**, I suck at Connect 4 and wanted to build a robot that could beat my friends in my place

Below I describe the design and implementation of the robot but if you want to see it in action, here's two videos:

## Design Goals

The robot had to meet the following requirements:
- **Play Connect 4**: The robot should be able to play Connect 4 on a physical board
- **Simple mechanical design**: The robot should be easy to build and maintain
- **Fast**: The robot should be able to play a game in a reasonable amount of time

## Mechanical Design

At the start, I was most unsure about how the actuate the robot. I considered a few options:

1. I could have seven different hoppers â€“ one above each column:
- But this would require seven servos and was IMO excessive.
2. One hopper attached to a timing belt so it could be positioned with a stepper?
- With stepper motors, I'd have to home it and then keep track of its position.

Eventually, I settled on a design with a fixed hopper and a plane mounted to a servo that would cover all columns up to the one I wanted to place a game piece in:

With this decided, I created a CAD model of the robot in Fusion 360. I made the thickness of all the extruded pieces parametric so I could easily adjust them before laser cutting and used finger-joints to allow for easy assembly.

  <Connect4Robot position={[-3,0,0]} />
</ModelViewer>

### The Gotchas

It took a few iterations to get the design right. Here are some of the issues I ran into:

1. **Aryclic vs Plywood:** Initally I wanted to use acrylic but it was too brittle and would crack when I tried attach the pieces. I switched to plywood which was much easier to work with.

2. **Ensuring pieces fell into the right place:** I had to experiment with the angle of the plane so the pieces would roll but not so fast that they'd miss the column they were supposed to go in. Additionally, I added a lip after each hole in the plane to stop the pieces from rolling further.

3. **Game pieces would get stuck on plane:** I had to add tape to the front and back plane to reduce friction. Additionally, I made the plane out of aryclic so that it was more slippery.

All in all, I went through 5 iterations of the design before I was happy with it.

## Electrical Design

### Detecting Game Pieces

I used seven [RPR-220](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/rohm-semiconductor/RPR-220/638554) reflective photosensors to detect when a game piece had fallen into a column. These are a single package with an LED and phototransistor. I placed them at the top of each column. I used copper-tape to ground both ground legs and connected the signal legs to the PSoC. 

<ProjectImage src={PhotoInterrupters} alt="Photointerrupters on back of robot with copper tape" />

The current through the phototransistor varies with the amount of light reflected back. The datasheet specifies that at 6mm the current is 100% and it drops off when a piece falls in front. Therefore I used a pull-up resistor such that when a piece falls down the current drops and the voltage goes high. Since I used red and yellow game pieces the current never went to 0% so I adjusted my resistor value until the PSoC read a high voltage when a piece was in front of the sensor (around 1.25V).

### Displaying the Game Board 

I used a [HiLetgo ILI9341 TFT Screen](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073R7BH1B?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details). It is a 2.8" touch screen with an SD card reader. Additionally, PSoC supports the emWin library which makes it relatively easy to draw shapes and text on the screen.

### Playing sound effects

I used a 8-ohm speaker along with a LM386 amplifier to play sound effects. As I only wanted to play tones I didn't need to implement any filters.

### Actuating the robot

Finally to actuate the robot I used two servos. One to move the plane and the other to drop the game pieces.

## Software Design

My high level software design was:

<ProjectImage src={SoftwareFlowchart} alt="Software flowchart" />

The full code can be seen on [Github](https://github.com/r-bt/Connect4-PSOC)

All the code was written in C. I tried dividing the code into modules to make it easier to debug and test. Here are the modules I used:

### TFT Screen

I used the emWin library to draw the game board and game pieces on the screen. I also display a settings screen where the user can select: the difficulty level, who goes first, and whether they want to play on the robot or the screen.

<ProjectImage src={SettingsScreen} alt="Settings displayed on TFT Screen" />

There are two modes: screen play and robot play. In screen play the user uses the touchscreen to select which column to drop a piece in. During both modes the robot displays taunts to the user. I used the emFile library to read taunts from a text file on a SD card. 

<ProjectImage src={ScreenGameplay} alt="A game of Connect-4 on the TFT screen" />

### Connect4 Game and AI

I implemented Connect4 using a bitboard representation as described [here](https://github.com/denkspuren/BitboardC4/blob/master/BitboardDesign.md). For each player I stored a 64-bit number where a 1 represented their game piece and a 0 represented an empty space or the other player's piece. 

The benefit of this representation is that I can efficently check for wins by using bitwise operations. 

<ProjectImage src={BitboardRepresentation} alt="Connect-4 bitboard representation" /> 

I implemented the AI using a [minimax algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax). The idea is that the AI has a **heuristic** function that evaluates a given board state. I then simulate all possible moves up to a certain depth and choose the move that maximizes the heuristic for the AI and minimizes it for the player.

I allowed the user to choose three difficulty levels: 
1. **Easy**: The AI only looks one move ahead
2. **Medium**: The AI looks five moves ahead
3. **Hard**: The AI looks 10 moves ahead

However, at 10 moves ahead the AI would need to evaluate 7^10 = 282,475,249 moves which was too slow. Therefore, I implemented two optimizations:

1. **Negamax**: I simplified the minimax algorithm by using the zero-sum property of the game. The AI player's score is the negative of the human player's score. Therefore, I only need to implement the max part of the algorithm.
2. **Alpha-Beta Pruning**: I used alpha-beta pruning to reduce the number of nodes I needed to evaluate. The idea is that I maintain two values, alpha (the best guaranteed score for the maximizer) and beta (the best guaranteed score for the minimizer). I can then prune all nodes that are less than alpha or greater than beta.

For the heuristic function, I gave each position a value for example the lowest row on the center column is the best position to play in. Then I calculate the score for each player by summing the values of their pieces and add extra points if they have three-in-a-row. 

<ProjectImage src={PositionValues} alt="Values given to Connect-4 positions" />

### Controlling the robot

First, to detect the pieces I had an interrupt triggered by the photointerrupters. I had to debounce the signal as the controller was fast enough to detect the piece multiple times as it fell.

Then, I manually found the right PWM values to move the plane and drop the pieces. I had to account for the slight wiggle of the servo.

Occassionally, the piece would fall into the wrong column. I had the robot always detect where it's piece actually fell and roll with it if it was in the wrong column. This isn't a real fix but I think it adds some randomness which makes the game more fun since you can occassionally actually win.

## PSOC Hardware

One of the major draws to the PSoC is it's programmable hardware. The PSoC comes with a bunch of blocks you can instantiate and connect to each other to make DACs, ADCs, PWMs, etc. I used the following blocks:

<ProjectImage src={PSoCHardware} alt="PSoC Hardware" />

1. **SPI**: To communicate with the TFT screen
2. **Digital Pins**: To communicate with the TFT touchscreen module
3. **PWM**: To control the servos
4. **USBUART**: To send debug information to my computer
5. **emFile**: To read files from the SD card
6. **Digital Pins + Interrupt**: To read the photointerrupters
7. **VDAC and DMA**: To play sound effects

## Conclusion

My Connect-4 Robot was a fun project to build. I learned a lot about embedded systems, game playing AI, and mechanical design. I also got to play a lot of Connect-4 but I can't say I got any better at it. There was a lot of work in designing, building, and debugging the robot but it was all worth it to see it in action. Above is only a high-level overview of the project. If you're interested in more details, feel free to reach out to me or look through the code.
