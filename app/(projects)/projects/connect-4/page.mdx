In Spring 2024, I took 6.115 (Microcomputer Project Laboratory) at MIT. It takes a deep dive into embedded systems. Over four labs we built circuits and wrote code to

- Find the resonant frequency of an fluroscent light and strike it
- Display a laser light show
- Control a robot arm
- Reconstruct a 3D object from 2D images

All of which was done on a 8-bit [Intel 8051](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MCS-51) microcontroller which we programmed in assembly.

For the last month of the class we had a final project. The only critera is that it has to use the [Cypress PSoC 5LP](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/product/microcontroller/32-bit-psoc-arm-cortex-microcontroller/32-bit-psoc-5-lp-arm-cortex-m3/). 

I decided to build a robot that could play Connect 4 on a physical board for a few reasons

- I love building things that interact with the physical world
- I wanted to explore the algorithms behind a game-playing AI
- **Most importantly**, I suck at Connect 4 and wanted to build a robot that could beat my friends in my place

Below I describe the design and implementation of the robot but if you want to see it in action, here's two videos:

## Design Goals

The robot had to meet the following requirements:
- **Play Connect 4**: The robot should be able to play Connect 4 on a physical board
- **Simple mechanical design**: The robot should be easy to build and maintain
- **Fast**: The robot should be able to play a game in a reasonable amount of time

## Mechanical Design

At the start, I was most unsure about how the actuate the robot. I considered a few options:

1. I could have seven different hoppers â€“ one above each column:
- But this would require seven servos and was IMO excessive.
2. One hopper attached to a timing belt so it could be positioned with a stepper?
- With stepper motors, I'd have to home it and then keep track of its position.

Eventually, I settled on a design with a fixed hopper and a plane mounted to a servo that would cover all columns up to the one I wanted to place a game piece in:

With this decided, I created a CAD model of the robot in Fusion 360. I made the thickness of all the extruded pieces parametric so I could easily adjust them before laser cutting and used finger-joints to allow for easy assembly.

### The Gotchas

It took a few iterations to get the design right. Here are some of the issues I ran into:

1. **Aryclic vs Plywood:** Initally I wanted to use acrylic but it was too brittle and would crack when I tried attach the pieces. I switched to plywood which was much easier to work with.

2. **Ensuring pieces fell into the right place:** I had to experiment with the angle of the plane so the pieces would roll but not so fast that they'd miss the column they were supposed to go in. Additionally, I added a lip after each hole in the plane to stop the pieces from rolling further.

3. **Game pieces would get stuck on plane:** I had to add tape to the front and back plane to reduce friction. Additionally, I made the plane out of aryclic so that it was more slippery.

All in all, I went through 5 iterations of the design before I was happy with it.

## Electrical Design

### Detecting Game Pieces

I used seven [RPR-220](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/rohm-semiconductor/RPR-220/638554) reflective photosensors to detect when a game piece had fallen into a column. These are a single package with an LED and phototransistor. I placed them at the top of each column. I used copper-tape to ground both ground legs and connected the signal legs to the PSoC. 

<ProjectImage src={PhotoInterrupters} alt="Photointerrupters on back of robot with copper tape" />

The current through the phototransistor varies with the amount of light reflected back. The datasheet specifies that at 6mm the current is 100% and it drops off when a piece falls in front. Therefore I used a pull-up resistor such that when a piece falls down the current drops and the voltage goes high. Since I used red and yellow game pieces the current never went to 0% so I adjusted my resistor value until the PSoC read a high voltage when a piece was in front of the sensor (around 1.25V).

### Displaying the Game Board 

I used a [HiLetgo ILI9341 TFT Screen](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073R7BH1B?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details). It is a 2.8" touch screen with an SD card reader. Additionally, PSoC supports the emWin library which makes it relatively easy to draw shapes and text on the screen.

### Playing sound effects

I used a 8-ohm speaker along with a LM386 amplifier to play sound effects. As I only wanted to play tones I didn't need to implement any filters.

### Actuating the robot

Finally to actuate the robot I used two servos. One to move the plane and the other to drop the game pieces.

## Software Design

My high level software design was:

<ProjectImage src={SoftwareFlowchart} alt="Software flowchart" />

The full code can be seen on [Github](https://github.com/r-bt/Connect4-PSOC)

All the code was written in C. I tried dividing the code into modules to make it easier to debug and test. Here are the modules I used:

### TFT Screen

I used the emWin library to draw the game board and game pieces on the screen. I also display a settings screen where the user can select: the difficulty level, who goes first, and whether they want to play on the robot or the screen.

<ProjectImage src={SettingsScreen} alt="Settings displayed on TFT Screen" />

There are two modes: screen play and robot play. In screen play the user uses the touchscreen to select which column to drop a piece in. During both modes the robot displays taunts to the user. I used the emFile library to read taunts from a text file on a SD card.

## PSOC Hardware

One of the major draws to the PSoC is it's programmable hardware. The PSoC comes with a bunch of blocks you can instantiate and connect to each other to make DACs, ADCs, PWMs, etc. I used the following blocks:

<ProjectImage src={PSoCHardware} alt="PSoC Hardware" />

1. **SPI**: To communicate with the TFT screen
2. **Digital Pins**: To communicate with the TFT touchscreen module
3. **PWM**: To control the servos
4. **USBUART**: To send debug information to my computer
5. **emFile**: To read files from the SD card
6. **Digital Pins + Interrupt**: To read the photointerrupters
7. **VDAC and DMA**: To play sound effects
